# Zeitgeist Privacy Notice

## 1\. Introduction

The Centre for Collective Intelligence at Nesta delivers online and in-person workshops to let the public deliberate and be polled on topics and policy measures. We have developed a platform called Zeitgeist which helps us to carry out this work by using content hosting (video, text, images) for explaining policy issues; with interactive polling features and real-time group-level results. It is used to support facilitated deliberation of small groups; with functionality to support in-person and remote participation. Certain data collected from those workshops is analysed to inform and provide recommendations for the topic or policies being discussed. This privacy notice together with the workshop information sheet explains how we collect and use your personal data when you participate in our workshops and use Zeitgeist.

## 2\. Contact details

Nesta is the data controller and is responsible for your personal data collected in connection with your use of Zeitgeist. This means that we will be responsible for keeping your information safe and only using it for the purposes set out in this notice.

We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy notice. If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights in relation to your personal data, please contact the DPO and provide enough information to identify yourself (e.g. your name and address):

If you are unhappy about how we use your personal data or have a complaint, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please do contact us in the first instance.

## 3\. What personal data will we collect?

1. **Identifiable data**
   - Display name

     When participating in a workshop and using Zeitgeist you will be invited to provide a display name. This is to facilitate the delivery of the workshop but it will not be stored by Zeitgeist after the end of the workshop session.

   - Email address (optional)

     You will have the option to provide your email address when using Zeitgeist. This could be for the purposes of receiving invitations to other workshop sessions in the future, to sign up to receive marketing emails from us (see section 5 below) or to sign up to receive a participation voucher (where applicable).

In addition, we may collect the following additional data from you which is collected and stored in a **non-identifiable** way. This means that it is either entirely anonymous, or it is psuedo-anonymised (i.e. the data collected in a manner that means we know that the data belongs to a specific individual but we cannot identify that the individual is you).

2. **Non-identifiable data**
   - Non-identifiable workshop session data including:
     - Recordings and transcriptions of discussions

     - Responses to questions about your policy opinions

   - Certain non-identifiable demographic information. The categories of demographic information may change depending on the focus of the workshop session and examples are listed below. Please see the workshop information sheet for more information about the non-identifiable demographic data that will be collected.
     - Ethnicity

     - Age range

     - First half of postcode

We may also collect the following technical data about your connection and device to help us diagnose issues and improve the performance of Zeitgeist.

3. **Usage Data**
   - IP address

   - Browser type

   - Device information

   - Operating system

   - Date and time of access

## 4\. What do we do with information we collect and what is our legal basis for this?

The purpose for which we are processing your data is to carry out the workshops and analysis explained in the workshop information sheet, and to learn how best to improve the Zeitgeist product. We use Zeitgeist to help us to carry out this work.

We may also use the data for wider research purposes and we will have appropriate safeguards in place to respect your rights and freedoms when we do this. For example we will will only retain your data for research purposes in either an anonymised form (i.e. so all identifying information is removed) or in a psuedo-anonymised form (i.e. the data is collected in a manner that means we know that the data belongs to a specific individual but we cannot identify that the individual is you).

Data protection law requires us to have a specific legal basis for processing your personal data.

Our lawful basis for using your data will be our legitimate business interest in running the workshop and carrying out analysis described in the workshop information sheet and the wider research. This project advances our organisation’s aims including undertaking innovative research, evaluation and information activities that will deliver social impact.

In addition:

- We may also use your Usage Data for our legitimate business interest of helping us to diagnose issues and improve the performance of Zeitgeist.

- Where you have provided your email address for the purposes of receiving invitations to other workshop sessions in the future or to sign up to receive marketing emails from us, our legal basis will be your consent – see section 5 below for more information.

- Where you have provided your email address for the purposes of receiving a participation voucher (where applicable), our legal basis will be to fulfil our agreement with you to provide a participation voucher.

## 5\. Marketing

If you sign up to our mailing list we will use your details to keep you informed about latest news, blogs, programme updates, research, publications, event details, jobs and funding or participation opportunities, and may request feedback, including our annual audience survey.

We use third party providers to deliver our e-newsletters. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter. We currently use Mailchimp, Salesforce and Eventsforce. Mailchimp and Salesforce servers are hosted in the U.S.A. All data entered onto Eventsforce is stored and managed in the UK. If you want to know more about how your information will be stored and processed see the privacy policies for SalesForce, MailChimp and Eventsforce.

If you no longer want to receive marketing communications from us, you can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link, at the bottom of our emails or by contacting us using the details set out at 2 above detailing your name and email address.

## 6\. Who has access to your information?

Your information will be accessed by a limited number of researchers and advisors in our project team working on this project.

Where we are carrying out this project in collaboration with other organisations, we may share your data with those organisations for the purposes of the project and you will be notified of this in the workshop information sheet.

Where we are carrying out wider research in collaboration with other organisations, we may share your data with those organisations for the purposes of that research but we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to respect your rights and freedoms when we do this. For example, your data will only be shared for wider research purposes in either an anonymised form (i.e. so all identifying information is removed) or in a psuedo-anonymised form (i.e. the data is collected in a manner that means we know that the data belongs to a specific individual but we cannot identify that the individual is you).

In addition, we may disclose your information to third parties in connection with the purposes of processing your personal data set out in this notice. These third parties may include:

- other companies in our group;

- regulators, law enforcement bodies and the courts, in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, assist with regulatory enquiries, and cooperate with court mandated processes, including the conduct of litigation;

- suppliers, research assistants and sub-contractors who may process information on our behalf e.g. cloud services to store data. These third parties are known as data processors and when we use them we have contractual terms and policies and procedures in place to ensure that your personal data is protected. This does not always mean that they will have access to information that will directly identify you as we will share anonymised or pseudonymised data only wherever possible. We remain responsible for your personal information as the controller; and

- any third party to whom we are proposing to sell or transfer some or all of our business or assets.

We may also disclose your personal information if required by law, or to protect or defend ourselves or others against illegal or harmful activities, or as part of a reorganisation or restructuring of our organisations.

## 7\. International Transfers

Except as set out at paragraph 5, your personal data will not be transferred outside of the UK and the European Economic Area.

## 8\. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information and follow procedures designed to minimise unauthorised access, alteration, loss or disclosure of your information.

## 9\. Data Retention

**General principle:** We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal data, it will be securely deleted.

Taking the above factors into consideration, our anticipated date of deletion for your personal data is:

- **Identifiable data**
  - Display Name

    This is only used during your participation in the workshop session and is deleted as soon as you disconnect from the Zeitgeist platform after ending your participation in the workshop session.

  - Email address

    Where you have provided your email address for the purposes of receiving invitations to other workshop sessions in the future or to sign up to receive marketing emails, we will retain this data unless you unsubscribe from receiving such communications from us.

    Where you have provided your email address for the purposes of receiving a participation voucher (where applicable), we will delete your email address after we have sent the voucher to you.

- **Non-identifiable data**

  We retain the non-identifiable data (including non-identifiable workshop session data and non-identifiable demographic data) indefinitely for research and statistical purposes. We will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to respect your rights and freedoms when we do this. For example, your data will only be retained in either an anonymised form (i.e. so all identifying information is removed) or in a psuedo-anonymised form (i.e. the data is collected in a manner that means we know that the data belongs to a specific individual but we cannot identify that the individual is you).

- **Usage data**

  We may retain Usage Data in an anonymised format indefinitely so we can use it to help improve the Zeitgeist platform.

We keep records of consent, and any withdrawal of consent, on our files for as long as your personal information is being used in-line with that consent and for a period of 6 years after the consent is withdrawn (unless otherwise requested by you).

## 10\. Your legal rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including rights to:

- Request access to your personal data: this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check we are lawfully processing it.

- Request correction of your personal data: this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.

- Request erasure of your personal data: this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.

- Object to processing of your personal data: for example, you can object where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

- Request restriction of processing your personal data: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data.

- Data portability: Where the processing takes place on the basis of your consent or contract, and is carried out by automated means, you have the right to request that we provide your personal data to you in a machine-readable format, or transmit it to a third party data controller, where technically feasible.

- Right to withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data: This applies where we have relied on consent to process personal data. Please note that withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before withdrawing your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please send your specific request to the Data Protection Officer using the contact details provided at section 2.

It is important to understand that the extent to which these rights apply to research will vary and that in some circumstances your rights may be restricted. Please also note that we can only comply with a request to exercise your rights during the period for which we hold personal information that identifies you.

## 11\. Changes to this Notice

We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If we make any significant changes in the way we treat your personal information we will contact you directly.
